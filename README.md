# School-Spring-Boot

Welcome to my personal training repository! ðŸš€

This repository hosts a Java Spring Boot application showcasing a school management system. Built to hone my skills, this project utilizes the power of Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to create a robust backend architecture.

Key features include:

CRUD Operations: Seamlessly manage students, teachers, administration, and courses.
Microservice Architecture: Experience the efficiency of microservices with a dedicated module handling CRUD functionalities for courses.
Feel free to explore the codebase and provide feedback. This project is a reflection of my ongoing learning journey, and your insights are invaluable.

Happy coding! ðŸ“šâœ¨
